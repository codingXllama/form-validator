In a form we need to have the following tags 

formStart  - parent  <form>
label - used for accessibility and it contains instructions for the form (user prompt) <label> </label>
input - this the input data that will be passed into our form ex. text,pw,email,etc. (takes user data) <input type ="email">  //this tag does not need a closing tag
formEnd - end of form </form>


-**- you can also add form attributes  (maxlength, minlength, required, value, type,etc.)

* Box-shadow *

➡️ it contains 5 values

1️⃣  Horizontal offset - shadow that goes left to right (set it to 0 if you want it to go top to bottom)
2️⃣  vertical offset - it's the top to bottom value (A positive value means the shadown will be on the bottom and negative value means it will be on the top) ex. 5px means 5px shadow on bottom
3️⃣ shadow blur - how much out do you want to see the shadow
4️⃣ shadow spread - this is the shadow size 
5️⃣ rgba value - color (rgba(0,0,0,alpha/opacity)) ex. rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
